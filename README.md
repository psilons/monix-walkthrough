# Scala 3rd Party Lib Walk Through

The common version of the libraries that we are currently interested in is 2.12.
So we have to live with this, feel kind of wasting time or can't wait to get to 
Scala 3.

We choose not to use parent-child build hierarchy here, because these are prototypes
and we want to keep independent from each other and copy-paste later is easier
with self contained content.
