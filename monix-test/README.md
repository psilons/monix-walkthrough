# Monix Walkthrough

The APIs are confusing, not well designed - doing simple tasks in a complex way.
Not sure whether Scala3 causes problems.

## Set up

We use Scala 3, so go to https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.scala-lang/scala3-library
to find the latest version.

Go to https://monix.io/ to find latest version.

Add these 2 versions to the build.sbt. Refresh sbt view and make sure the libs
are there.
