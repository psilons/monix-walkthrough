# Scala Graph

It seems that this is not a popular library since there are not many web pages on the internet,
except its own pages. A loose comparison is 
https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=graphx,networkx,scala-graph.
So there are not a lot of references availble for troubleshooting and understanding.
